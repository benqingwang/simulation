<h2>Installing Arena</h2>
If you would like to download, install, and run Arena locally on your Windows computer, please go to
https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/products/software/arena-simulation/buying-options/
download.html and fill out the form. You can put Georgia Tech as the Organization and Job Type as
Student. You should get an email with instructions on how to download and install the software after
you do this. The email might be routed to your Spam folder.
Arena is already installed on the Virtual Lab desktops, so you do not not need to go through this
process if you use that option.
You will have a student license which will limit the number of entities in the queue and the number of
module blocks. These limitations will not prohibit you from completing the homework assignments.
